A README file serves as the main entry point for people to understand your project on GitHub. It should provide a clear overview of the project, instructions for installation, usage, and relevant details to help others (and yourself) run the project in the future.

Here’s a detailed structure for the README file to accompany your ETL solution:

# ETL Solution for Hospital Customer Data

This project demonstrates an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) solution to process customer data from a multi-specialty hospital chain. The solution parses customer data files, transforms them by calculating age and days since last consultation, and then loads the records into country-specific tables in an SQLite database.

## Project Overview

The hospital collects customer data from its various global locations, which are stored in a single file. The project performs the following steps:
1. **Extract**: Load the data from files.
2. **Transform**:
   - Calculate derived columns (age and days since last consultation).
   - Validate data consistency.
3. **Load**: Insert the data into country-specific tables in an SQLite database.

This ETL process is designed to handle large volumes of data efficiently.

---

## Prerequisites

To run the project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **SQLite** (pre-installed with Python)

You can also install a database browser like **DB Browser for SQLite** to view the resulting database easily:
- [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/)

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2. **(Optional) Set up a virtual environment**:
    - On macOS/Linux:
      ```bash
      python3 -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```
    - On Windows:
      ```bash
      python -m venv venv
      .\venv\Scripts\activate
      ```

3. **No additional libraries** are required, since we are using SQLite, which comes bundled with Python.

---

## Usage

1. **Modify the sample data**:
   You can modify the sample data inside the script (`import_csv.py`):
   ```python
   data = [
       ['Alex', '123457', '20101012', '20121013', 'MVD', 'Paul', 'SA', 'USA', '06031987', 'A'],
       ['John', '123458', '20101012', '20121013', 'MVD', 'Paul', 'TN', 'IND', '06031987', 'A'],
       # Add more rows here as needed
   ]
   ```

2. **Run the ETL process**:
   To run the ETL process, execute the Python script:
   ```bash
   python import_csv.py
   ```

3. **View the generated SQLite database**:
   After running the script, a database file named `hospital_data.db` will be created in the project directory. You can inspect the database using:
   - **Command-line**:
     ```bash
     sqlite3 hospital_data.db
     ```
     Then run queries like:
     ```sql
     .tables
     SELECT * FROM table_usa;
     ```

   - **SQLite Browser**: Open `hospital_data.db` in **DB Browser for SQLite** and explore the data tables.

---

## Features

- **Data Extraction**: Loads and parses customer data from the input file.
- **Data Transformation**:
   - Calculates derived columns such as `age` and `days since last consultation`.
   - Validates data fields like customer ID and date formats.
- **Data Loading**: Inserts the transformed data into country-specific SQLite tables.
  
---

## Testing

To test the solution in your local environment:
1. Modify the sample data in the script.
2. Run the script as shown in the **Usage** section.
3. Use an SQLite browser to verify the tables and data.

You can also run basic queries to check if the age and days-since-consulted calculations are working properly.
