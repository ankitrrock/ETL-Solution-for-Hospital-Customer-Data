# ETL Solution for Hospital Customer Data
 This project demonstrates an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) solution to process customer data from a multi-specialty hospital chain. The solution parses customer data files, transforms them by calculating age and days since last consultation, and then loads the records into country-specific tables in an SQLite database.
